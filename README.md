# CF - Concert Finder
Concert Finder is a SPA that helps users find concerts. A user can search by performer or city. The following are results from the query:\
-Performer name
-Music genre
-Location
-Date of event
-Average price (if available)
-A link to buy tickets
-An embedded spotify player for that performer (if available)
-Google maps embed with centered on the venue location.

Results are displayed in a grid via CSS Grid template. 

## Getting Started

[Click here to check out the app](https://skieronski-bcv.netlify.app) \
Select "Performer" or "City" in the dropdown menu at the top-middle of the screen. Next, enter your query in the "Search" text field.

I have always wanted more information about the performers and venues for music concerts / festivals. This app sets out to provide that in easily accessible and minimalistic ways. The results provided are the absolute basics of what people want to know about when hearing about a concert. In addition to this, the spotify embed provides a quick way to hear what that performer is like. The google maps embed gives the user a general idea of where the concert is, in which they can click on a link in the map to go to the Google Maps page and see more info about the venue or get directions.
